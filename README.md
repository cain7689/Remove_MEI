# Remove_MEIXXXXX
The Remove_MEIXXXXX.bat file deletes _MEIXXXXX files from Windows temp folder that are old or are no longer used by the windows or any other application.
The files or folders that are used by the windows will not be removed or affected.
I have also added another batch file to create schedule to clear the temp folder on system startup.
